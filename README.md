# STK-Driven-Satellite-Beam-Steering-Using-Delay-and-Sum-Beamforming
This project demonstrates satellite beam steering using STK-driven orbital geometry and Delay-and-Sum beamforming in MATLAB. Azimuth and elevation data from STK are used to compute URA steering vectors and DAS weights. The beamformer output Y = WᴴX and radiation pattern are evaluated to visualize real-time satellite tracking.
